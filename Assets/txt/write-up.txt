The screenshots are different output from different heuristic methods working on the same startnode node4 to the same goalnode node122.
In the non-cluster A* method, the algorithm will only consider the recent movement cost and the Manhattan distance.
In the A* method with cluster heuristic, the algorithm will have a more accurated prediction when it compares the costs of nodes in different cluster.
